Databases

Good Questions:

Databases are organized collection of data stored electronically in a computer system.
Main works of databases are creating tables and databases, adding, deleting, updating, modifying, querying data.
DBMS: Database Management Software

Interaction with databases:
Via coding (on a software) -> compile(interacts with db) -> query

MySQL vs SQL:
MySQL: RDBMS that uses SQL as its query language
SQL Structured Query Language: Programming language (By IBM in 1970s) => Programming language to communicate and manipulated data in databases. Performs CRUD operation, querying, retrieving data, defining data, creating complex relations, controlling permissions, etc

Types of Databases
- Relational databases (stores data in rows and columns)
"""
Relational databases understands only SQL: Each table => has rows and columns, each column => has data type and name, each row => record of data
"""
  - MySQL
  - PostgreSQL
  - Microsoft SQL Server
  - etc

- Non Relational databases (data not stored in tables)
- NoSQL databases (different formats)
  - MongoDB (Document database) (JSON)
  - Cassandra 
  - Redis (Key-Value database) (key-value store)
  - Graph databases (Neo4j) (nodes, edges, and properties)
  - etc

- Time Series databases
- Object Oriented databases
- In memory databases
- etc

ACID: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability

Atomicity: ensures that each transaction is treated as a single unit. So each transaction either fully gets done or not done. Eg. A bank transfer
Consistency: There is no difference in the working of any of the unit. Rules are maintained
Isolation: Each transactions are independent of each other.
Durability: Ensuring each task/transaction gets committed, irrespective of success/failure. Means we should come to end to know the result, not hold up.

Importances:
- Data handling
- Error handling
- Reliability
- Rules and order


Basic SQL:
- SQL Commands (DDL, DML, DCL, DQL, TCL)
- DROP vs DELETE vs TRUNCATE
- Data types (string/varchar, int, DATE, float/decimal, Boolean) IDENTITY Column
- Contraints (PRIMARY and FOREIGN key)
- Normatization in SQL (1NF, 2NF, etc)
- OPERATORS (Arithmetic, logical, etc)
- CASE statements/ nested statements
- CLAUSES (Distinct, order by, etc)
- INNER JOIN

Intermediate SQL:
- Group by and HAVING clause
- Aggregate function (min, max, etc)
- Sub queries
- Order of Execution
- Different types of joints, self join
- CTE tables/ WITH clause
- In-built functions
- Window Function
- Views

Advanced SQL:
- PIVOT Tables, CROSSTAB function
- Recursive SQL queries
- Materialized views
- Stored procedures
- User Defined Functions

MySQL:
======

Storing databases: In servers => MySQL Servers: database server from where data is accessed, stored and managed
MySQL Workbench: UI to interact with the databases.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiS_mWZmmI0

Methods:
 - Command line
 - MySQL workbench
 - Using Python/JS/etc

DATETIME: 'DDDD-MM-YY' , eg: SELECT * FROM table WHERE DATE>='2024-12-01'

Primary Key: Uniquely identifies each row of the table. (Unique, non Null, immutable(can't be changed once defined), can be single column or group of columns

CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(100)
);


Foreign Key: A column in database table that creates a relationship between rows in two tables. Points to primary key of another table. Establish relationship and references. Can contains Null values if relationship is optional.

CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    order_date DATE,
    customer_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
);

Type of SQL commands:
- DDL: Data Definition Language (Define the structure and schema of the database - CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE, RENAME)
- DML: Data Manipulation Language (Manipulate data stored in the database - INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- DCL: Data Control Language (Deals with control and security of data within the database - GRANT, REVOKE)
- DQL: Data Query Language (Retrieve data from the database - SELECT)
- TCL: Transaction Control Language (Manage transactions in the database - COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT)


DROP vs DELETE vs TRUNCATE:
--------------------------
DROP: Deletes the entire table data, its indexes etc. (Irreversible)
DELETE: Deletes particular records of the table based on a specific condition. (Conditional, can be reversed)
TRUNCATE: Deletes all the data rows of the table but maintains the table structure for future use.

Creation of Database:
---------------------

Database -> tables (having some rule (constrains) for the table)
Schema -> table details (how the table is defined -> characteristics, attributes, names, data types, etc)

Attributes: Characteristic(columns) of the table, eg. FirstName, LastName, RollNum, etc
Record: Rows of the table, eg. Harsh, Agarwal, 71

Constrains: Rules applied to columns to ensure data integrity and consistency.
PRIMARY KEY constrains, SECONDARY KEY constrains, NON NULL constrains, UNIQUE constrains, CHECK constrains

Log in to MySQL Server:
mysql -u root -p 
or
MySQL -u username -p

CREATE DATABASE databaseName;
or
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS databaseName; (prevents error)

USE databaseName; => Using this particular database

///////////// EXAMPLE /////////////

-- Create database only if it does not exist
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS mydatabase;

-- Use the database
USE mydatabase;

-- Create table only if it does not exist
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS customers (
    customer_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Drop table only if it exists
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS customers;

-- Drop database only if it exists
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS mydatabase;

////////////////////////////////////

SHOW DATABASES;  => list all the databases present in the server

Rename a Database:
In MySQL: => create a new database -> copy contents of old db to new db -> delete old db
In PostgreSQL: => ALTER DATABASE old_database_name RENAME TO new_database_name;
In SQL Server: => ALTER DATABASE old_database_name MODIFY NAME = new_database_name;

Tables:
=======

SHOW TABLES; => list all the tables inside a database
Multiple PRIMARY KEY in a table is not possible, however composite PRIMARY KEY is possible.

Insert values into table:
------------------------

INSERT INTO tableName (column1, column2, column3)
VALUES
(1, 'harsh', 1999),
(2, 'yash', 2002);

Fixed length input: CHAR(16): length 16 fixed size input


/////////////////example///////////////////

Data-types:

Numeric: INT, BIGINT, SMALLINT, FLOAT, DOUBLE, DECIMAL
String: VARCHAR(n), CHAR(n), TEXT
Datetime: DATE, TIME, DATETIME, TIMESTAMP
Boolean: BOOLEAN
Binary: BINARY(n), VARBINARY(n), BLOB

INT: integer (-214 Cr to +214 Cr)
BIGINT: big integer
SMALLINT: small integer (-65k to +65k)

FLOAT: 4-bit decimal
DOUBLE: 8-bit decimal
DECIMAL(p, s): for exact number representation p:precision, s:scale

UNSIGNED: If we want only positive 

Eg: CREATE TABLE salary(
	salary INT UNSIGNED
    );

CHAR(n) (0-255 size): fixed length - waste of memory if <n size data provided
VARCHAR(n) (0-255 size): variable length - no waste of memory if <n size data provided
TEXT: variable length with no specific limit

DATE: YYYY-MM-DD
TIME: hh:mm:ss
DATETIME/TIMESTAMP: YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss

=======================
==  GETTING LAST DAY ==

recordDate - INTERVAL 1 DAY

////////
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT w1.id
FROM Weather AS w1
LEFT JOIN
Weather AS w2
ON w1.recordDate - INTERVAL 1 DAY = w2.recordDate
WHERE w1.temperature>w2.temperature;
//////
=======================

BOOLEAN: storing true/false

BINARY(n): fixed length binary data
VARBINARY(n): variable length binary data
BLOB(binary large object): for storing large amount of binary data (variable length)

Binary stores 0/1

Constraints in SQL: rules or conditions that must be satisfied by the data in the table
List of contraints are:
- PRIMARY KEY constraint: unique and non null identifier value for each record
- FOREIGN KEY constraint: refers to primary key of an another table. Establish relationship between tables
- NOT NULL constraint
- UNIQUE constraint
- CHECK constraint: ensures a condition to be true for each row
- DEFAULT constraint: provides a default value if no value is specified

CREATE TABLE table1(
  age INT CHECK(age>=18),
  enrolled BOOLEAN DEFAULT false
);

Other:
- UNSIGNED 
- AUTO_INCREMENT


CREATE TABLE childtableName (
childId INT PRIMARY KEY,
baseId INT,
FOREIGN KEY (baseId) REFERENCES baseTableName(baseId)
);

Foreign key also help in maintaining the referential integrity, meaning if some data is changed/deleted/updated in child table, that must gets updated in the parent table.

///////////////////////////////////////

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employee (
    empId INT,
    empName VARCHAR(20),
    departmentId INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (empId),
    FOREIGN KEY (departmentId) REFERENCES department(departmentId)
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS department (
	departmentId INT PRIMARY KEY,
    departmentName VARCHAR(30)
);

INSERT INTO employee(empId, empName, departmentId)
VALUES
(1, 'Harsh', 2),
(2, 'Yash', 3),
(3, 'Varsha', 2);

INSERT INTO department(departmentId, departmentName)
VALUES
(2, 'Engineering'),
(3, 'Management');

////////////////////////////////////////

Referenced Table: Table with primary key
Referencing Table: Table with foreign key

A table can have only 1 primary but can have multiple foreign keys.

Cascading in Foreign Key:
------------------------
1. CASCADE: If a row in the parent table is deleted or updated, all related rows in the child table will be automatically updated or deleted.
2. SET NULL: If a row in the parent table is deleted or updated, all the corresponding foreign key in the child table will be set to NULL
3. RESTRICT OR NO ACTION: Blocks the modification or deletion of the referenced row in the parent table if related rows exists in the child table, thus maintaining referential integrity.

ON DELETE CASCADE: If a row in parent table is deleted, all the corresponding rows in the child table will be automatically deleted as well.

CREATE TABLE referencingTable (
    column1 DATATYPE PRIMARY KEY,
    column2 DATATYPE,
    FOREIGN KEY (column1) REFERENCES baseTable(column1),
    ON DELETE CASCADE
);


ON UPDATE CASCADE: If a row in parent table is updated, all the corresponding rows in the child table will be automatically updated as well.

CREATE TABLE referencingTable (
    column1 DATATYPE PRIMARY KEY,
    column2 DATATYPE,
    FOREIGN KEY (column1) REFERENCES baseTable(column1),
    ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

ALTER command: command used to change existing database objects like tables, indexex, or constrains (schemas)

It involves addition or column, removal of column, modification of column, etc

ADD COLUMNS:

ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD column_name data_type constrains;

DROP COLUMN:

ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP COLUMN column_name;

MODIFY clause:
-------
It is used with ALTER TABLE in SQL which allows us to change the definition or properties of an existing column in a table.

ALTER TABLE table_name
MODIFY column_name newDataType;

CHANGE THE NAME OF EXISTING COLUMN:
---------------------------------
ALTER TABLE table_name
CHANGE old_column_name new_column_name newDataType;

RENAME: renaming the column, index, table, etc

ALTER TABLE table_name;
RENAME COLUMN old_column_name TO new_column_name;


Renaming table: RENAME TABLE old_table_name TO new_table_name;
Renaming database: RENAME DATABASE old_database_name TO new_database_name;

Truncate Command:
===============

TRUNCATE TABLE table_name; removes all the entries of the table, maintaining its structure.

DISTINCT: for selecting distinct column from the table.

Operators in SQL:
----------------

- +, -, /, *, %
- AND
- OR
- NOT

- >, <, >=, <=, !=, = 
- IN: SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column IN ('A', 'B');
- IS NULL
- IS NOT NULL: SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column IS NOT NULL;
- BETWEEN : SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary BETWEEN 100000 AND 300000;

LIKE and Wildcard operators:
==========================
%: matches any sequence of zero or more characters.
_: matches single character.

SELECT * FROM table WHERE name LIKE '%A';
SELECT * FROM table WHERE name LIKE '_%A';


Clauses in SQL: tools/conditions that makes queries more specific or decide what data to fetch.
----------

- WHERE: Conditional
- GROUP BY
- HAVING
- ORDER BY: Sorting the results in ascending or descending order.
- LIMIT: Limits the number of rows returned

SELECT *
FROM table_name
CLAUSE condition;

SELECT *
FROM table_name
WHERE age>20
ORDER BY age DESC
LIMIT 5;

Aggregate functions: performs operations on a set of rows and returns a single value summarizing the data.
------------------

- COUNT: Count number of rows or number of non null values in a column
	SELECT count(column_name) FROM table WHERE age>=20;
- SUM: Returns sum of all values
	SELECT sum(salary) FROM employees;
- AVG: Returns average of all values
	SELECT avg(salary) FROM employees;
- MIN: find smallest value
- MAX: find largest value 
- GROUP_CONCAT


Group By and Having:
===============

Group By: Group the data on the basis of similar rows (categorize data). It organizes data into groups on which calculations can be performed.

SELECT col, AVG(column_name)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY col;

Having: Work with GROUP BY as a conditionals. (Filter grouped data)

SELECT col, AVG(column_name)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY col
HAVING condition;

RENAMING OUTPUT COLUMN:

SELECT col AS new_name
FROM table_name;

GROUP BY FOR 2 COLUMNS:
-----

SELECT *
FROM table_name
GROUP BY col1, col2
HAVING condition;


WHERE v/s HAVING:
===========

WHERE
- Used with SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT commands
- SELECT * FROM table WHERE condition;

HAVING
- Used with GROUP BY clause and AGGREGATE functions
- SELECT col1, AVG(col2) FROM table GROUP BY column HAVING condition;

Order of SQL commands:
===========

SELECT
DISTINCT, AGGREGATE FUNCTION
FROM 
WHERE
GROUP BY
HAVING
ORDER BY
LIMIT

Joins in SQL:
------

Used to combine two or more tables in SQL based on related or shared or common column between tables.

- INNER JOIN
- LEFT JOIN / LEFT OUTER JOIN
- RIGHT JOIN / RIGHT OUTER JOIN
- FULL JOIN / FULL OUTER JOIN
- SELF JOIN
- CROSS JOIN

Is Foreign Key important for performing joins?
- Joins are simply performed based on columns that establish relationship between tables, be it foreign key column or any other column. So, FK is not necessary for joins.

INNER JOIN:
-------

SELECT *
FROM table_name1
INNER JOIN table_name2
ON table_name1.prop = table_name2.prop

LEFT/RIGHT OUTER JOIN:
--------

SELECT *
FROM table_name1
LEFT JOIN table_name2
ON table_name1.prop = table_name2.prop

FULL JOIN:
---------
Returns matching row of both the left and right table and also includes all rows from both the tables even if they don't have matching rows. If no match, null values are returned for the column values of missing table.

In MySQL, there is no direct way to use full join, so we combine LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN and UNION


/////////////////////////////
SELECT *
FROM table_name1
INNER JOIN table_name2
ON table_name1.prop = table_name2.prop

UNION

SELECT *
FROM table_name1
LEFT JOIN table_name2
ON table_name1.prop = table_name2.prop
/////////////////////////////

CROSS JOIN:
---------
It combines each row of the first table with every row of the second table.

SELECT *
FROM table_1
CROSS JOIN table_2;

Resultant table: m(table1 row size) x n(table2 row size)

SELF JOIN:
---------
It is a type of join where a table is joined with itself. It is a type of inner join.

SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name AS t1
SELF JOIN table_name AS t2
ON t1.column_name = t2.column_name;

////////////////Example//////////////

INSERT INTO employees (id, namex, mentorId)
VALUES
(1, 'Harsh', 3),
(2, 'Yash', 1),
(3, 'Himanshu', 1),
(4, 'Priti', Null);

SELECT *
FROM employees;

SELECT e1.id, e1.namex, e1.mentorId, e2.namex AS mentor
FROM employees AS e1
JOIN employees AS e2
ON e1.mentorId = e2.id;

/////////////////////////////////////

Exclusive Joins in SQL:
-----------------

Exclusive: excluding something
Join: combining 2 tables

It is exclusive of the overlap rows.

Left Exclusive Join: Left Join - overlap

SELECT *
FROM table_one
LEFT JOIN
table_two
ON table_one.col = table_two.col
WHERE table_two.col IS NULL;

Right Exclusive Join: Right Join - overlap

SELECT *
FROM table_one
RIGHT JOIN
table_two
ON table_one.col = table_two.col
WHERE table_one.col IS NULL;

Full Exclusive Join: Full Join - overlap

SELECT *
FROM table_one
LEFT JOIN
table_two
ON table_one.col = table_two.col
WHERE table_two.col IS NULL

UNION

SELECT *
FROM table_one
RIGHT JOIN
table_two
ON table_one.col = table_two.col
WHERE table_one.col IS NULL;


//////////////
SELECT *
FROM corpemp
RIGHT JOIN
department
ON corpemp.departmentId = department.departmentId
WHERE corpemp.departmentId IS NULL;
//////////////

UNION operator:
--------

Combine the result of """2 or more""" SELECT queries into a single result set and gives unique rows by removing the duplicate rows.
- Each SELECT command retrieved data must have same number of columns
- Data type in columns of table retrieved from SELECT command must match
- Columns should be listed in same order across all SELECT statements

SELECT col1, col2
FROM table1
UNION
SELECT col1, col2
FROM table2;


UNION ALL operator:
---------

Combine the result of """2 or more""" SELECT queries into a single result set and gives all the rows by not removing the duplicate rows.
- Same rules as UNION are applied

SELECT col1, col2
FROM table1
UNION ALL
SELECT col1, col2
FROM table2;


SQL Subquery/inner query/nested query:
===================================

SQL subquery: Query nested with another SQL statement. Used whenever we wanted to retrieve data based on the result of another query.

Using Subquery:

- Using with SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE: SELECT *, (subquery) FROM table;
- Using with FROM: SELECT * FROM subquery;
- Using with WHERE clause to filted data based on conditions: SELECT * FROM table WHERE column_name OPERATOR (subquery);

LIMIT:
-----

LIMIT n: To retrieve the top n rows from the table

LIMIT m, n: 
 - m: number of rows to skip from the beginning
 - n: number of rows to retrieve after skipping

n-th Highest salary:
-----

SELECT *
FROM Salary
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT n-1, n;

STORED PROCEDURES:
----------------

It is like a function. Stored procedures are used to store SQL commands under a specific name, and are called later.

Creating the procedure:
CREATE PROCEDURE procedureName()
BEGIN
Query;
END;

CALL procedureName;  Calling the procedure

Eg:

CREATE PROCEDURE getAllOrderDetailsById(IN id int) 
BEGIN
SELECT * FROM table_name
WHERE id = id;
END;


Delimiter:
-----

Tells where my query is going to end

DELIMITER / (Tells to end at /)

Creating the procedure:
CREATE PROCEDURE procedureName()
BEGIN
Query;
END / (ends here)

DELEIMITER ; (Sets ending back to ;)

VIEWS:
------
Views are virtual tables in SQL. It provides filtered view of data for the security purpose.

CREATE VIEW viewName AS
query;

// See data in view
SELECT * FROM viewName;

// Drop view
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS viewName;


IFNULL:
-----

SELECT ISNULL(Query, output) AS name;

IFNULL takes 2 arguments: Query: Which if returns null, prints the second argument (output).

ROUND:
----

ROUND(col_name, 0): Round decimal to 0 places (i.e. returns INT)
